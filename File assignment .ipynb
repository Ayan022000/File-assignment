    "r: This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file doesn't exist, it will raise an error.\n",

    "a: This mode opens the file for appending. If the file doesn't exist, it will create a new file. If the file exists, the new data you write to the file will be appended to the end of the file.\n",
    "x: This mode opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, it will raise an error.\n",
    "b: This mode is used for binary files. It must be used in combination with one of the other modes. For example, rb will open the file for reading in binary mode.\n",

    "The close() function is used to close a file in a program after the file has been opened for reading or writing. It is important to close a file after using it because it releases the resources associated with the file, such as memory and processor time, and ensures that all data is written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is opened, the operating system creates a file object that keeps track of the file's location, status, and other important information. When the close() function is called on this file object, it notifies the operating system that the file is no longer being used by the program, and the file object is destroyed. This frees up system resources and ensures that other programs can access the file if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't close a file after using it, it can lead to several problems, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Resource leaks: If you open too many files without closing them, you may run out of system resources, which can cause your program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Data loss: If you don't close a file after writing data to it, some or all of the data may not be written to the file. This can result in data loss, which can be difficult or impossible to recover.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.File corruption: If you don't close a file after writing data to it, the file may become corrupted. This can happen if the program crashes or if there is a power outage or other system failure while the file is open.\n",
